# SecureLinkConnect

Welcome to the **SecureLinkConnect** project! This is a Node.js application that demonstrates how to establish secure connections and communication between a client and a server using JSON Web Token (JWT) authentication and encryption techniques. The project aims to provide a comprehensive example of implementing secure communication over a network.

## Project Overview

**SecureLinkConnect** is designed to showcase how to create secure connections between a client and a server using JWT authentication and encryption. It demonstrates the process of generating JWT tokens, sending them with encrypted data, and verifying them on the server side. The project serves as an example for those interested in implementing robust security measures in their applications.

## Features

- Secure communication between a client and a server using JWT tokens.
- Encryption of data on the client side before transmission.
- Decryption of data on the server side.
- Example implementation of JWT token generation, verification, and encryption/decryption using Node.js.
- Simple CLI interface for interaction.
